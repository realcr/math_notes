A list of papers was given at the beginning of the lesson.


\uline{The first two articles:}


$n \geq 1$. $S_n$ permutation.
$T = \{Transpositions\} \subseteq S_n$.
$|T| = \over{n}{2}$.

Fix $\t \geq 1$. Let $T_1, \dots T_t$ be i.i.d $unif(T)$.
Put ${\Pi}_t = T_t \compose \cdots \compose T_1$.


Every permutation is a composition of transpositions.

\begin{thm} (Schramm)
  $t = cn$, $c > 1/2$ const, let $(y_1,y_2,\dots)$ be the ordered cycles sizes
  of ${Pi}_t$, then $\left(y_1/n,y_2/n,\dots) {\rightarrow}^d (X_1,X_2,\dots)$
    (Poisson-Dirichlet distribution).
\end{thm}

Analogy: Look at the random graph of $n$ vertices, and we put an edge $(i,j)$ if
there is $T_k$, $1 \leq k \leq t$ which is the transposition $(i,j)$.


If $c < 1/2$ then all the connected components in the graph are smaller than
$\log(n)$.
If $c > 1/2$, then there is one linear (Of linear size) connected components,
and all the rest are of logarithmic size.

We are not sure if all the transpositions inside the giant connected component
will compose together to be one cycle.

\begin{thm} (81, Diaconis-Shashahani)
  $||{\Pi}_t - \Pi||_{TV} = o_n(1), c > 1/2$ and $1-o_n(1)$ when $c<1/2$.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm} (Berestycki)
Simpler proof and more general for $k$-cycles.
\end{thm}


\uline{Articles 3 and 4}

$G = (V,E)$ is inifinitely connected graph.
For every $K \subseteq V$, $|K| < \inft$, $d_E{K} : \{\mbox{Edges with one
endpoint in $K$}\}$.

Cheeger constant:
${\Phi}_E{G} = \inf \{ \frac{|d_E{K}}{|K|} : K \subseteq V Finite, k \neq
\emptyset\}$.

If ${\Phi}_E(G) > 0$ then $G$ is non amenable.

A grid graph is not amenable (The cheager constant will be $0$), however the
${\Phi}_E(\mathcal{T}_d) = d-2$.


$G$ ->  $P(x,y) = 1/deg(x)$ if $x~y$, and $0$ otherwise.

$(Pf)(x) = {\sum}_y p(x,y)f(y)$

$||P||_{op} = sup \{ \frac{||Pf||_2}{||f||_2} : f \neq 0\}$

$||P||_{op} \leq 1$


\begin{prop}
$G$ Cayley's graph.
$p^n(x,x) := $ Probability after $n$ steps is at $x$.

$\ro = {\lim}_{n \rightarrow \inft} (p^{2n}(x,x))^{(1/2n)} = ||P||_{op}$.
\end{prop}

\begin{thm}
  ${{{\Phi}_E}^2}/2 \leq 1 - \ro \leq {\Phi}_E$

\end{thm}

$\ro(T_d) = \frac{2\sqrt(d-1)}{d}$.

\begin{thm}
  Kesten (64)
  $G$ is a cayley graph ($d$-regular), $\ro(G) \geq \ro(T_d) = 2\sqrt(d-1)/d$.
  And $\ro(G) = 2\sqrt(d-1)/d$ iff $G=T_d$.

\end{thm}

Extensions: (Paper 3): Simpler proofs and some more general graphs.


\uline{The Percolation articles}

Percolation: $G$ infinite connected graph, $p \in [0,1]$.
Delete each edge with probability $1-p$, retain with probability $p$.
$G$ is a cayley graph.

$E$: There exists infinite connected component. (Check that this event is
measurable).

By the Kolmagorov theorem, the probability of this event must be either $0$ or
$1$.

A result by Kesten-Harris: $p_c(\mathcal{Z}^2) = 1/2$.


When is $p_c < 1$? $\mathcal{Z}$.
Conjecture: Every Cayley graph of growth $>1$, $p_c < 1$.

It is known when $G$ has polynomial growth. $|B(0,r)| \leq Cr^D$, and when $G$
is non amenable. Also known when $G$ has exponential growth.
